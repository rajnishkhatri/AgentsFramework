# Lightweight decision log

> Append-only, newest first. 2–4 lines per **small** decision: what was decided,
> the alternative rejected, and why. This is the low-friction sibling of the full
> ADRs — use a numbered ADR (`0000-template.md`) for big/structural decisions that
> need Context/Options/Rationale/Consequences; use this for the long tail of
> non-obvious-but-small choices that would otherwise go uncaptured. Lower the bar,
> capture more intent debt. (Playbook: Comprehension-Debt runbook, Part B.)

- 2026-06-28 — `.cursor/hooks.json` `afterFileEdit` kept `failClosed:false`.
  Rejected flipping it to `true` (the harness plan's blanket contract). Why: the
  post-edit ruff hook is advisory formatting (HOOK-1 never-block-on-edit); a
  formatter hiccup must not block an edit. Scoped deviation, documented inline in
  the file. The safety gate `beforeShellExecution` stays `failClosed:true`.
