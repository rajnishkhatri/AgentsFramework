# Lightweight decision log

> Append-only, newest first. 2–4 lines per **small** decision: what was decided,
> the alternative rejected, and why. This is the low-friction sibling of the full
> ADRs — use a numbered ADR (`0000-template.md`) for big/structural decisions that
> need Context/Options/Rationale/Consequences; use this for the long tail of
> non-obvious-but-small choices that would otherwise go uncaptured. Lower the bar,
> capture more intent debt. (Playbook: Comprehension-Debt runbook, Part B.)

- 2026-06-30 — ADR-0007 capability-gating derives the coach's bound tool set from
  a **build-time capability list** (`build_graph(bound_capabilities=…)`), not per-run
  from the `agent_capabilities` resolved into state. Rejected per-run binding: it
  would force the `call_llm` node to recompute tool schemas each turn (build-once is
  the current contract) for a benefit — one graph serving many identities — the
  coach doesn't need. Matches the ADR's "graph-build boundary" wording. Flag OFF by
  default (`capability_gating_enabled`); the run-time `authorization_service` PEP is
  unaffected and complementary (bind-time filter + run-time authz).
- 2026-06-28 — ADR.1 ratchet mechanism = a git-diff **arch-test**
  (`tests/architecture/test_adr_ratchet.py`), not a Stop hook. Rejected the
  Stop-hook trigger (harness v2 item 2.1's first option): a hook can't capture the
  typed human answer the gate wants (honest limit), is version-dependent, and
  doesn't run in CI. The arch-test wires the already-shipped pure detector
  (`detect_adr1_missing`) against the merge-base diff and is version-independent.
  Waiver: an `ADR-OK: <reason>` token in a commit message of the range.
- 2026-06-28 — `.cursor/hooks.json` `afterFileEdit` kept `failClosed:false`.
  Rejected flipping it to `true` (the harness plan's blanket contract). Why: the
  post-edit ruff hook is advisory formatting (HOOK-1 never-block-on-edit); a
  formatter hiccup must not block an edit. Scoped deviation, documented inline in
  the file. The safety gate `beforeShellExecution` stays `failClosed:true`.
